# Todo

Keep one prioritized todo per line. Agents must:

1. Read this file and pick the top unfinished task.
2. If unclear, ask one clarifying question.
3. Complete the task, then mark it done with a short comment and date.

Format:
- [ ] <task description> — owner: <name> — created: YYYY-MM-DD
- [x] <completed task> — done: YYYY-MM-DD — note: <1–2 line summary>

Example:
- [ ] Add CI workflow for pnpm workspace — owner: emnom — created: 2026-01-11
